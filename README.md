This project is a recreation of the classic Donkey Kong arcade game developed as part of the COP 3003 course. It demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java, including class design, inheritance, encapsulation, and basic game mechanics. The game features core elements such as player movement, obstacles, scoring, and win/loss conditions in a 2D environment. 

## About This Project

This is a retro-style Donkey Kong clone built in Python for educational purposes as part of the COP-3003 course. The game simulates platform-based gameplay mechanics, helping students understand object-oriented programming, game loops, and sprite interaction.
